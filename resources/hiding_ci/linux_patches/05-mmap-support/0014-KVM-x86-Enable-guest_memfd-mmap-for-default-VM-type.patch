Subject: [PATCH 14/45] KVM: x86: Enable guest_memfd mmap for default VM type

Enable host userspace mmap support for guest_memfd-backed memory when
running KVM with the KVM_X86_DEFAULT_VM type:

* Define kvm_arch_supports_gmem_mmap() for KVM_X86_DEFAULT_VM: Introduce
  the architecture-specific kvm_arch_supports_gmem_mmap() macro,
  specifically enabling mmap support for KVM_X86_DEFAULT_VM instances.
  This macro, gated by CONFIG_KVM_GMEM_SUPPORTS_MMAP, ensures that only
  the default VM type can leverage guest_memfd mmap functionality on
  x86. This explicit enablement prevents CoCo VMs, which use guest_memfd
  primarily for private memory and rely on hardware-enforced privacy,
  from accidentally exposing guest memory via host userspace mappings.

* Select CONFIG_KVM_GMEM_SUPPORTS_MMAP in KVM_X86: Enable the
  CONFIG_KVM_GMEM_SUPPORTS_MMAP Kconfig option when KVM_X86 is selected.
  This ensures that the necessary code for guest_memfd mmap support
  (introduced earlier) is compiled into the kernel for x86. This Kconfig
  option acts as a system-wide gate for the guest_memfd mmap capability.
  It implicitly enables CONFIG_KVM_GMEM, making guest_memfd available,
  and then layers the mmap capability on top specifically for the
  default VM.

These changes make guest_memfd a more versatile memory backing for
standard KVM guests, allowing VMMs to use a unified guest_memfd model
for both private (CoCo) and non-private (default) VMs. This is a
prerequisite for use cases such as running Firecracker guests entirely
backed by guest_memfd and implementing direct map removal for non-CoCo
VMs.
