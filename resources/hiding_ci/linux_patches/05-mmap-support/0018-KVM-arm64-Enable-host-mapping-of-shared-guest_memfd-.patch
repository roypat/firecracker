Subject: [PATCH 18/46] KVM: arm64: Enable host mapping of shared guest_memfd
 memory

Enable host userspace mmap support for guest_memfd-backed memory on
arm64. This change provides arm64 with the capability to map guest
memory at the host directly from guest_memfd:

* Define kvm_arch_supports_gmem_mmap() for arm64: The
  kvm_arch_supports_gmem_mmap() macro is defined for arm64 to be true if
  CONFIG_KVM_GMEM_SUPPORTS_MMAP is enabled. For existing arm64 KVM VM
  types that support guest_memfd, this enables them to use guest_memfd
  with host userspace mappings. This provides a consistent behavior as
  there are currently no arm64 CoCo VMs that rely on guest_memfd solely
  for private, non-mappable memory. Future arm64 VM types can override
  or restrict this behavior via the kvm_arch_supports_gmem_mmap() hook
  if needed.

* Select CONFIG_KVM_GMEM_SUPPORTS_MMAP in arm64 Kconfig.

* Enforce KVM_MEMSLOT_GMEM_ONLY for guest_memfd on arm64: Checks are
  added to ensure that if guest_memfd is enabled on arm64,
  KVM_GMEM_SUPPORTS_MMAP must also be enabled. This means
  guest_memfd-backed memory slots on arm64 are currently only supported
  if they are intended for shared memory use cases (i.e.,
  kvm_memslot_is_gmem_only() is true). This design reflects the current
  arm64 KVM ecosystem where guest_memfd is primarily being introduced
  for VMs that support shared memory.
